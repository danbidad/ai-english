today we're going to run some
experiments we're building the biggest
and most powerful Mini PC in the world
armed with two power supplies three
adapters and two gpus one of which is
RTX 490 at the end we'll compare it with
a desktop PC powered by an I9 14900 K
the Mini PC arrives in two boxes so
let's start by unboxing this one which
contains the Mini PC itself called the
belink gti1 14 Ultra AI PC Inside the
Box aside from the aluminum case that
resembles Apple's Mac Mini you'll find
two cables an HDMI and a power cable
this Mini PC is certainly not light
considering its cases made of aluminum
which I hope helps with cooling the
processor the port selection's pretty
good I like the USBC and card reader on
the front let's take it apart and see
what's inside the screws are hidden
under rubber plugs which are not easy to
remove and can be easily lost if you're
not careful once all the screws are out
the bottom cover comes off without much
effort beneath it there's a coarse dust
filter held by four screws removing it
reveals access to the built-in power
supply and dual sub wolfers whose sound
changes depending on how the PC is
positioned on the table I'll show that
later the power supply seems to be rated
at 140 Watts I'm not an expert in power
supply circuit design but I can at least
pretend to know what I'm looking at for
those who do understand this stuff it
might be interesting I noticed that the
cooling for the power supply relies only
on thermal pads and the case itself next
we need to remove a plate held by three
screws and one post which is an easy to
unscrew of course every Homemaker has
pliers in the kitchen just for jobs like
this after removing this armor plate we
gain access to two crucial ddr5 RAM
sticks totaling 32 GB at 5,600 MHz and a
1 TB gen 4x4 SSD there are two nvme
slots for ssds and one for a Wi-Fi 7
module the standoff system looks
interesting but isn't very convenient
for disassembly luckily compared to the
Mac Mini almost all the screws in this
Mini PC are the same size making it
easier to reassemble still the
complexity level of this machine is
evident on your screens removing the
motherboard from the case is not
straightforward both the cooling system
and the board itself are quite Hefty
let's take off the fan and check out the
heat sink cooling the processor we've
got a full Copper design with one wide
copper heat pipe now let's see what's
underneath it appears the processor is
cooled using liquid metal which is great
but over time it could dry out due to
direct contact with the copper which
oxidizes ideally the heat pipe should be
nickel plated to keep the liquid metal
from solidifying in any case it's much
better than traditional thermal paste in
terms of cooling especially considering
the processor here is quite powerful an
Intel Core Ultra 7 155h with 16 cores
and 22 threads I also decided to check
whether a discrete GPU would work if
connected almost directly to the
built-in pcii Express x16 slot I'm
connecting it via a flexible fire hose
as the power supply and a few protruding
components block the GPU from being
installed directly I'm curious whether
this setup will run with a standard
desktop power supply everything's ready
to go I turned on the PC and as you can
see it boots up and even displays an
image on the monitor the slot operates
in X8 mode not x16 which means there are
only eight pcie lanes available on the
CPU even though the slot physically
looks like a 16 Lane one however after
installing the drivers for the GPU
issues began to appear it seems the x16
slot isn't providing power to the GPU
and it starts lagging right on the
desktop unfortunately this setup does
not work in our case I also tried
connecting the GPU via the m.2 nvme slot
as this method should provide power
directly to the x16 slot on the graphics
card theoretically increasing the
chances of success I booted up our
Frankenstein and once again it
successfully powered on but sadly it
began lagging on the desktop just like
before so running a discrete GPU is only
possible through the proprietary dock
station on the other hand why turn your
PC into a Frankenstein when you can buy
a ready-made Solution that's Compact and
more convenient assembling this PC is a
real test for your patients as there are
more components here than in a typical
desktop build one of the more difficult
tasks was putting together just the
power button which also functions as a
fingerprint scanner it's not the most
convenient Mini PC for quick access to
the SSD and RAM although you probably
won't need to disassemble it every day
for the price of 850 bucks it's a bit
much for such a box and I've realized
that most of the cost is for the CPU
itself but for the compactness and the
options to connect a discrete GPU it
might be worth the premium and that's
not all it offers next I'll show you the
BIOS capabilities of this Beast the
belink dedicated graphics docking
station allows us to connect the most
powerful GPU in the world to our very
large Mini PC simply put it's a power
supply unit with a riser for the GPU the
kit includes the dock itself and a
safety frame I've forgotten what the USB
port is for but you can install an
external Wi-Fi with the Tenna as you can
see this board is equipped with eight
PCI lanes for the GPU keeping in mind
that the processor also supports a
maximum of eight Lanes there's even a
connector for an additional fan let's
take a closer look inside our dock to
see what else it has to offer the back
cover is secured by just four screws and
once removed we gain access to the power
supply and a slot for Wi-Fi or another
SSD there's so much space in here that
you could even hide something here's how
the components of our powerful 600 W
power supply look today I'm going to
push it to the Max and see if it really
delivers 600 WS taking it apart revealed
that it's not just a power supply and
riser but also has enough space for
secret compartments which explains the
$160 price tag for a power supply alone
that's quite expensive but considering
all the extra features it might be worth
paying for the compactness and minimal
cabling the downside of this power
supply is that it doesn't come with a
600 W cable for modern gpus it only has
two old standard 8 Pin connectors a
particularly tricky move was making
these two connectors identical to the
ones on the GPU that means the ports
differ from those on regular power
supplies not knowing this I decided to
skip buying an adapter for modern gpus
and instead used a full cable from
another power supply imagine my
disappointment when I realized that the
keys on the cable connectors and the
power supply don't match and then I
looked at the pin layout and thought why
not just cut off the key pins on the
cable to fit it into the connector the
world wasn't ready for such dumb ideas
unfortunately nothing caught fire the
power supply just triggered its
protection mode and refused to power on
but I didn't stop there I pulled out the
two wires that were causing the short
circuit and tried powering on the supply
again it worked encouraging me to
continue the experiment in the end the
GPU didn't pull more than 90 watts in
game so I quickly abandoned this idea as
a bad dream considering how my blood
pressure spikes when I mess with the
$1,500 GPU eventually I bought three
adapters two of them split one pin cable
into two eight pins and the third was
the standard Nvidia adapter for four
eight pins this way we'll attempt to
overclock the GPU in this setup if we
connect all these Pokémon together we
get a solid and reliable like The
Budapest memorandum 600 wat bouquet to
power the GPU I rambled so long that the
computer decided to assemble itself
Jokes Aside it actually goes together
quite easily you just take the power
supply put it on the table grab the Mini
PC with your left hand find the GPU
connector and hook it up to the docking
station we then plug in our fiery 28 pin
cables take the safety frame components
and secure them Min PC so that thieves
can't easily steal it add another
element secure it with two screws from
the bottom so our budget RTX 490 which
we powerfully shoot like me from all
angles inserted into the slot is firmly
fastened with two more included screws
finally we try to click the 16 pin
connector into place creating an
anaconda of cables that need to be
wrangled together it looks way too
aggressive in my opinion but hey we've
built the largest mini piece in the
world so it fits take a look at this 88
mm anti-aircraft gun terrible thing the
Germans used to put such things on tiger
tanks now this is what I call a glimpse
into the future comparing it to a
regular pc the size difference is
obvious one can easily fit it into a
backpack for a quick trip while the
other requires a car to transport the
largest Mini PC weighs only 5.3 kg
whereas a mini tower with the same
graphics card can weigh up to 8.6 kg G
turning it on is a bit different from a
typical PC because we have two power
supplies that need to be plugged in
first we press this button then the
button on the mini PC itself and it
should power on safety first so I
decided to check our bouquet and the
power supply for stability and heat I
ran a firm Mark test removed the power
limit on the GPU and as you can see it's
pulling 540 to 550 WS after 10 minutes
of testing the power supply didn't shut
down and all the connection wires were
only slightly warmed so the setup's
pretty solid an interesting feature in
the Bios you can overclock the RAM and
even adjust its voltage though I won't
be doing that of course you can also set
any power limit for the CPU 54 65 or
even 100 Watts however the manufacturer
claimed that this Mini PC is designed
for a Max of 65 Watts so I set it to 65
and here's the difference in gaming
between 54 Watts 65 watts and 80 WT
power consumption there's almost none
I've never seen worse efficiency give
you an idea the frequencies are
different even if you can't really see
it before I forget let me show you a
comparison of the sound from this Mini
PC with the sound from an iPhone 16 Pro


Max as you heard the Mini PC sounds
better on the recording but in real life
the iPhone has a basier though quieter
sound unfortunately I can't test the
microphone because that would require me
to travel from the US to Ukraine to
record my voice and I'm not sure why you
think this is the voice of AI maybe
because of some errors in the script I
was actually hired to do the voice over
just so you know I also noticed that the
gaming tests are the least viewed even
though I spend the most time on them so
if you're interested in seeing the
results of the built-in Intel art
graphics card testing feel free to pause
and take a look look at the FPS I'm also
curious about the performance loss in
games due to using only eight PCI
Express Lanes in this Mini PC the loss
ranges from 0% to 5 to 8% which is
almost negligible compared to a full 16
Lane interface even more interesting to
me is the power of the ultra 7 155h
processor compared to the I9 14900 K
which has had its power consumption
limits removed as you can see in older
games like GTA 5 the difference is
minimal but in games like Allen wake 2
and similar titles the Gap can be as
much as twofold in favor of the I9 14900
K in rdr2 the i 94900 k produced so many
frames that the test even stopped
running normally as you may have noticed
it also hit the monitor's refresh rate
without that limitation it would have
been around 200 FPS however the power
consumption of the I9 14900 K is
outrageous compared to the ultra
755h and while we don't see the
frequency and power consumption of the
mobile processor since Unfortunately
they aren't displayed rest assured it
constantly consumed 65 Watts meanwhile
the I9 14900 K occasionally exceeded 200
Watts the Mini PC is almost silent in
operation and the CPU temperatures don't
rise above 80° in benchmarks the ultra 7
155h scores half as many points as the
top I9 14900 K meaning its raw
performance is half however in practice
the performance difference in various
tasks can be both smaller and larger for
example in video rendering the I9 is
about 50% faster not 100% as in the
benchmarks so this Mini PC is a decent
option for those who have limited desk
space and don't need excessive CPU power
moreover as the test showed it's far
from a weak processor in most games it
exceeds 100 FPS except for cyberpunk
2077 though if dlss is turned off the
issues won't be the CPU but rather the
GPU so as you've understood this was a
commercial review if anyone liked this
Mini PC I'll leave a link to the
manufacturer's website in the
description below the video they have
plenty of interesting stuff there thank
you for your attention and see you next
time
