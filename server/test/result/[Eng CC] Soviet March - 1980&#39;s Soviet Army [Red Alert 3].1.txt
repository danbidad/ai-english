The whole world from Europe to the Neva to the east
Above the ground everywhere will sing:
The capital, vodka, the Soviet bear!

To all those around us, it's not worth your while
If we were to turn you to ashes.
We thank you profoundly, and bow to you deeply,
From the mightiest nation in all the world.
